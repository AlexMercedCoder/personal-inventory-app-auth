## Utils Documentation

#### Purpose:
The `utils` folder in an Express.js project is designed as a centralized place for various utility functions, custom middleware, and other reusable code snippets. This organization aids in maintaining clean and manageable code.

#### Examples of Contents:
1. **Custom Middleware**: Functions that process incoming requests before reaching routes. For example, authentication middleware to verify user credentials.
2. **Utility Functions**: Commonly used helper functions. E.g., a function to format dates or sanitize inputs.
3. **Configuration Files**: Setup files for external services or APIs.
4. **Database Helpers**: Functions to simplify database interactions, like query builders.

#### Benefits:
- Encourages modular and reusable code.
- Simplifies maintenance and enhances project structure.
- Reduces code duplication across different parts of the application.
